1. Story

They once sat side by side in a classroom filled with afternoon sunlight.
They laughed, shared snacks, doodled in notebooks, and stared at the sky together.
It felt ordinary — ordinary enough to last forever.

But forever ended quietly. One day, she was gone. No goodbye, no promise, no reason to wait.
The boy thought time would erase her.

Yet, in his dreams, he still waits.
And in those dreams, she searches for him — even if in reality, she may have already forgotten his name.
The dream becomes the only place where what he waits for, seeks him back.
