## 🎥 Story Summary  

They once sat side by side in a classroom filled with afternoon sunlight.  
They laughed, shared snacks, and drew doodles together. It all felt ordinary — ordinary enough to last forever.  

But forever ended quietly. One day, she was gone. No goodbye, no promise.  
He thought time would erase her… but in his dreams, he still waits.  
And in those dreams, she searches for him.  

The dream becomes the only place where **what he waits for, seeks him back.**
